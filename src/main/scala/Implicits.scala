    Aggregation Pipeline Operators

    Stage Operators

    Pipeline stages appear in an array. Documents pass through the stages in sequence.

    db.collection.aggregate( [ { <stage> }, ... ] )
    Name  Description
    /** \$project  Reshapes each document in the stream, such as by adding new fields or removing existing fields. For each input document, outputs one document. */

    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$out",value,other)

    Expression Operators

    These expression operators are available to construct expressions for use in the aggregation pipeline.

    Operator expressions are similar to functions that take arguments. In general, these expressions take an array of arguments and have the following form:

    { <operator>: [ <argument1>, <argument2> ... ] }
    If operator accepts a single argument, you can omit the outer array designating the argument list:

    { <operator>: <argument> }
    To avoid parsing ambiguity if the argument is a literal array, you must wrap the literal array in a $literal expression or keep the outer array that designates the argument list.

    Boolean Operators
    Boolean expressions evaluate their argument expressions as booleans and return a boolean as the result.

    In addition to the false boolean value, Boolean expression evaluates as false the following: null, 0, and undefined values. The Boolean expression evaluates all other values as true, including non-zero numeric values and arrays.

    Name  Description
    /** \$and  Returns true only when all its expressions evaluate to true. Accepts any number of argument expressions. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$and",value,other)

    /** \$or Returns true when any of its expressions evaluates to true. Accepts any number of argument expressions. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$or",value,other)

    /** \$not  Returns the boolean value that is the opposite of its argument expression. Accepts a single argument expression. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$not",value,other)

    Set Operators
    Set expressions performs set operation on arrays, treating arrays as sets. Set expressions ignores the duplicate entries in each input array and the order of the elements.

    If the set operation returns a set, the operation filters out duplicates in the result to output an array that contains only unique entries. The order of the elements in the output array is unspecified.

    If a set contains a nested array element, the set expression does not descend into the nested array but evaluates the array at top-level.

    Name  Description
    /** \$setEquals  Returns true if the input sets have the same distinct elements. Accepts two or more argument expressions. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$setEquals",value,other)

    /** \$setIntersection  Returns a set with elements that appear in all of the input sets. Accepts any number of argument expressions. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$setIntersection",value,other)

    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$setDifference",value,other)

    /** \$setIsSubset  Returns true if all elements of the first set appear in the second set, including when the first set equals the second set; i.e. not a strict subset. Accepts exactly two argument expressions. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$setIsSubset",value,other)

    /** \$anyElementTrue Returns true if any elements of a set evaluate to true; otherwise, returns false. Accepts a single argument expression. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$anyElementTrue",value,other)

    /** \$allElementsTrue  Returns true if no element of a set evaluates to false, otherwise, returns false. Accepts a single argument expression. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$allElementsTrue",value,other)

    Comparison Operators
    Comparison expressions return a boolean except for $cmp which returns a number.

    The comparison expressions take two argument expressions and compare both value and type, using the specified BSON comparison order for values of different types.

    Name  Description
    /** \$cmp  Returns: 0 if the two values are equivalent, 1 if the first value is greater than the second, and -1 if the first value is less than the second. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$cmp",value,other)

    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$lte",value,other)

    /** \$ne Returns true if the values are not equivalent. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$ne",value,other)

    Arithmetic Operators
    Arithmetic expressions perform mathematic operations on numbers. Some arithmetic expressions can also support date arithmetic.

    Name  Description
    /** \$add  Adds numbers to return the sum, or adds numbers and a date to return a new date. If adding numbers and a date, treats the numbers as milliseconds. Accepts any number of argument expressions, but at most, one expression can resolve to a date. */
    def (other: Expression): Expression = Operator("","$add",value,other)

    /** \$subtract Returns the result of subtracting the second value from the first. If the two values are numbers, return the difference. If the two values are dates, return the difference in milliseconds. If the two values are a date and a number in milliseconds, return the resulting date. Accepts two argument expressions.
